Testing tests
=======================================

This is a series of testing exercises using the super lightweight Javascript unit testing library: "Tinytest.js".
The idea is to star reconstructing array methods such as forEach, filter, map and reduce, and continue with different ones in separate files.
The first three methods are done following Watch and Code "Testing" section (although I try the exercises before the videos, so differences are expected). Whatever follows next are exercises on my own.
